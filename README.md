Recent graduate with Master in Information Management from KU Leuven, I'm passionate about continuous learning and professional growth. I also completed my BSc in Business Administration from KU Leuven with an exchange semester at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, where I developed a keen interest in Computer Science and Data Science.

My coursework and experience in programming, finance, and data analysis give me a unique perspective on solving complex business problems.

My self-taught programming skills include web development using HTML/CSS(bootstrap), Javascript (node, express, ejs, strapi), Python(flask, jinja), SQL/NOSQL(sqlite, mongo), SPSS, Git and Github. I also completed Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science, which taught me programming in C language, data structures, and algorithms. Moreover, I have been enrolled in HYF Bootcamp for Web Development, where I learnt more about web development best practices.

In my current role as a finance assistant, I'm responsible for creating reports using Google Data studio, Tableau, and Excel, leveraging pivot tables, and Excel macros. I'm also knowledgeable about automation tools such as ERP functions, webhooks, and custom plugins. Additionally, I help with data entry and provide justifications for external auditing of the company. I'm proficient in using BPMN for analyzing and improving business processes.

I'm excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to an organization's success in a meaningful way. Please feel free to connect with me if you think we can collaborate or have similar interests.
